A web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news using Mongoose and Cheerio.

NPM packages installed: express, express-handlebars, mongoose, body-parser, cheerio and request

Added mLab to support Heroku push.

How it works: Whenever a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from a news outlet and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to an application database.
